The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another.

          "context": "SIGNIFICANT FIGURES\nAs discussed above, every measurement\ninvolves errors. Thus, the result of\nmeasurement should be reported in a way that\nindicates the precision of measurement.\nNormally, the reported result of measurement\nis a number that includes all digits in the\nnumber that are known reliably plus the first\ndigit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus\nthe first uncertain digit are known as\nsignificant digits or significant figures. If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it\nwould give a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures\nindicate, as already mentioned, the precision\nof measurement which depends on the least\ncount of the measuring instrument. A choice\nof change of different units does not\nchange the number of significant digits or\nfigures in a measurement. This important\nremark makes most of the following\nobservations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 µm.\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\n2024-25\n\n\nPHYSICS\n4\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n•\nAll the non-zero digits are significant.\n•\nAll the zeros between two non-zero digits\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n•\nIf the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n•\nThe terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\n•\nThe trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has two significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10). In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a × 10b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a ≤5) and to 10\n(for 5<a ≤10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 107m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of\n10–10m, with the order of magnitude\n–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n 4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm\n        = 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures. However, all\nzeroes appearing in the base number in the\nscientific notation are significant. Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n•\nFor a number greater than 1, without any\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n•\nFor a number with a decimal, the trailing\nzero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\nexample in \n2\nd\nr =\n or  s = 2πr, the factor 2 is an\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\n2024-25\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT\n5\nor 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in \nt\nT\nn\n=\n, n is\nan exact number.\n1.3.1\nRules for Arithmetic Operations with\nSignificant Figures\nThe result of a calculation involving approximate\nmeasured values of quantities (i.e. values with\nlimited number of significant figures) must\nreflect the uncertainties in the original\nmeasured values. It cannot be more accurate\nthan the original measured values themselves\non which the result is based. In general, the\nfinal result should not have more significant\nfigures than the original data from which it was\nobtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured\nto be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and\nits volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its\ndensity, by mere arithmetic division, is\n1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal places.\nIt would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to\nrecord the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. The\nfollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result\nof a calculation is shown with the precision that\nis consistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three significant figures.\nDensity\n4.237g\n2.51 cm\n1.69 g cm\n3\n-3\n=\n=\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3.00 × 108 m s-1 (three significant figure) and\none year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m\n(three significant figures).\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least\ndecimal places.\nFor example, the sum of the numbers\n436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final result should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 ×10–3 m.\nNote that we should not use the rule (1) applicable\nfor multiplication and division and write 664 g as\nthe result in the example of addition and\n3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of subtraction. They\ndo not convey the precision of measurement\nproperly. For addition and subtraction, the rule\nis in terms of decimal places.\n1.3.2   Rounding off the Uncertain Digits\nThe result of computation with approximate\nnumbers, which contain more than one\nuncertain digit, should be rounded off.  The rules\nfor rounding off numbers to the appropriate\nsignificant figures are obvious in most cases.  A\nnumber 2.746 rounded off to three significant\nfigures is 1.75, while the number 1.743 would\nbe 1.74.  The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\ninsignificant digit to be dropped (the\nunderlined digit in this case)  is more than\n5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less\nthan 5.  But what if the number is 2.745 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\nis raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded\noff to three significant figures becomes 1.74.  On\nthe other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off\nto three significant figures becomes 1.74 since\nthe preceding digit is odd.\nIn any involved or complex multi-step\ncalculation, you should retain, in intermediate\nsteps, one digit more than the significant digits\nand round off to proper significant figures at the\nend of the calculation.  Similarly, a number\nknown to be within many significant figures,\nsuch as in 1.99792458  × 108 m/s for the speed\nof light in vacuum, is rounded off to an\napproximate value 3 × 108 m/s , which is often\nemployed in computations.  Finally, remember\nthat exact numbers that appear in formulae like\n2 π in T\nL\ng\n= 2π\n,  have a large (infinite) number\n2024-25\n\n\nPHYSICS\n6\n⊳\n⊳\nof significant figures. The value of π =\n3.1415926.... is known to a large number of\nsignificant figures. You may take the  value as\n3.142 or 3.14 for π, with limited number of\nsignificant figures as required in specific\ncases.\nExample 1.1  Each side of a cube is\nmeasured to be 7.203 m.  What are the\ntotal surface area and the volume of the\ncube to appropriate significant figures?\nAnswer   The number of significant figures in\nthe measured length is 4.  The calculated area\nand the volume should therefore be rounded off\nto 4 significant figures.\nSurface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2\n= 311.299254 m2\n= 311.3 m2\nVolume of the cube\n= (7.203)3  m3\n= 373.714754 m3\n= 373.7 m3\n⊳\nExample 1.2  5.74 g of a substance\noccupies 1.2 cm3.  Express its density by\nkeeping the significant figures in view.\nAnswer  There are 3 significant figures in the\nmeasured mass whereas there are only 2\nsignificant figures in the measured  volume.\nHence the density should be expressed to only\n2 significant figures.\nDensity =\n−\n5.74\n1.2 g cm 3\n                       = 4.8 g cm--3 .\n  ⊳\n1.3.3\nRules for Determining the Uncertainty\nin the Results of Arithmetic\nCalculations\nThe rules for determining the uncertainty or\nerror in the number/measured quantity in\narithmetic operations can be understood from\nthe following examples.\n(1) If the length and breadth of a thin\nrectangular sheet are measured, using a metre\nscale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there\nare three significant figures in each\nmeasurement.  It means that the length l may\nbe written as\n                       l = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm\n      = 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %.\nSimilarly, the breadth b may be written as\nb = 10.1  ± 0.1 cm\n   = 10.1 cm ± 1 %\nThen, the error of the product of two (or more)\nexperimental values, using the combination of\nerrors rule, will be\n    l b = 163.62 cm2 + 1.6%\n         = 163.62 + 2.6 cm2\nThis leads us to quote the final result as\nl b = 164 + 3 cm2\nHere 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the\nestimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified\nto n significant figures, a result obtained by\ncombining the data will also be valid to n\nsignificant figures.\nHowever, if data are subtracted, the number of\nsignificant figures can be reduced.\nFor example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to\nthree significant figures, cannot properly be\nevaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as\nuncertainties in subtraction or addition combine\nin a different fashion (smallest number of\ndecimal places rather than the number of\nsignificant figures in any of the number added\nor subtracted).\n(3) The relative error of a value of number\nspecified to significant figures depends not\nonly on n but also on the number itself.\nFor example,  the accuracy  in measurement of\nmass 1.02 g is ± 0.01 g  whereas another\nmeasurement 9.89 g is also accurate to  ± 0.01 g.\nThe relative error in 1.02 g is\n= (± 0.01/1.02) × 100 %\n= ± 1%\nSimilarly, the relative error in 9.89 g  is\n= (± 0.01/9.89) × 100 %\n                   = ± 0.1 %\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in\na multi-step computation should be\ncalculated to one more significant figure in\nevery measurement than the number of\ndigits in the least precise measurement.\nThese should be justified by the data and then\nthe arithmetic operations may be carried out;\n2024-25\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT\n7\notherwise rounding errors can build up. For\nexample, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after\nrounding off) to the same number of significant\nfigures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of\n0.104 calculated to three significant figures is\n9.62.  However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044\nand then taken the reciprocal to three significant\nfigures, we would have retrieved the original\nvalue of 9.58.\nThis example justifies the idea to retain one\nmore extra digit (than the number of digits in\nthe least precise measurement) in intermediate\nsteps of the complex multi-step calculations in\norder to avoid additional errors in the process\nof rounding off the numbers.",

All the physical quantities\nrepresented by derived units can be expressed\nin terms of some combination of seven\nfundamental or base quantities. We shall call\nthese base quantities as the seven dimensions\nof the physical world, which are denoted with\nsquare brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity. Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the\ndimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].\nAs the volume is independent of mass and time,\nit is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],\nzero dimension in time [T°] and three\ndimensions in length.\nSimilarly, force, as the product of mass and\nacceleration, can be expressed as\nForce   = mass × acceleration\n= mass × (length)/(time)2\nThe dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =\n[M L T–2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in\nmass, one dimension in length, and –2\ndimensions in time. The dimensions in all other\nbase quantities are zero.\nNote that in this type of representation, the\nmagnitudes are not considered. It is the quality\nof the type of the physical quantity that enters.\nThus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,\naverage velocity, final velocity, and speed are\nall equivalent in this context. Since all these\nquantities can be expressed as length/time,\ntheir dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T–1].",

A thorough\nunderstanding of dimensional analysis helps us\nin deducing certain relations among different\nphysical quantities and checking the derivation,\naccuracy and dimensional consistency or\nhomogeneity of various mathematical\nexpressions.  When magnitudes of two or more\nphysical quantities are multiplied, their units\nshould be treated in the same manner as\nordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel\nidentical units in the numerator and\ndenominator.  The same is true for dimensions\nof a physical quantity.  Similarly, physical\nquantities represented by symbols on both sides\nof a mathematical equation must have the same\ndimensions.\n1.6.1 \nChecking \nthe \nDimensional\nConsistency of Equations\nThe magnitudes of physical quantities may be\nadded together or subtracted from one another\nonly if they have the same dimensions.  In other\nwords, we can add or subtract similar physical\nquantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to\nforce, or an electric current cannot be subtracted\nfrom the thermodynamic temperature. This\nsimple principle called the principle of\nhomogeneity of dimensions in an equation is\nextremely useful in checking the correctness of\nan equation.  If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T–1].\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorrectness of the equation. However, the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions. The\narguments of special functions, such as the\ntrigonometric, logarithmic and exponential\nfunctions must be dimensionless. A pure\nnumber, ratio of similar physical quantities,\nsuch as angle as the ratio (length/length),\nrefractive index as the ratio (speed of light in\nvacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no\ndimensions.\nNow we can test the dimensional consistency\nor homogeneity of the equation\n(\n)\n2\n1/2  \n0\n0\nx\nx\nv  t\na t\n=\n+\n+\nfor the distance x travelled by a particle or body\nin time t which starts from the position x0 with\nan initial velocity v0 at time t = 0 and has uniform\nacceleration a along the direction of motion.\nThe dimensions of each term may be written as\n                 [x] = [L]\n               [x0 ] = [L]\n             [v0 t] = [L T–1]  [T]\n                     = [L]\n       [(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]\n                     = [L]\nAs each term on the right hand side of this\nequation has the same dimension, namely that\nof length, which is same as the dimension of\nleft hand side of the equation, hence this\nequation is a dimensionally correct equation.\nIt may be noted that a test of consistency of\ndimensions tells us no more and no less than a\ntest of consistency of units, but has the\nadvantage that we need not commit ourselves\nto a particular choice of units, and we need not\nworry about conversions among multiples and\nsub-multiples of the units.  It may be borne in\nmind that if an equation fails this consistency\ntest, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is\nnot proved right.  Thus, a dimensionally correct\nequation need not be actually an exact\n(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong\n(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be\nwrong.\nExample 1.3  Let us consider an equation\n      1\n2 m v\nm g h\n2 =\nwhere m is the mass of the body, v its\nvelocity, g  is the acceleration due to\ngravity and h is the height.  Check\nwhether this equation is dimensionally\ncorrect.\nAnswer  The dimensions of LHS are\n             [M]  [L T–1 ]2 = [M] [ L2 T–2]\n         = [M L2 T–2]\n2024-25\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT\n9\n⊳\n⊳\nThe dimensions of RHS are\n           [M][L T–2]  [L] = [M][L2 T–2]\n         = [M L2 T–2]\nThe dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and\nhence the equation is dimensionally correct.\n⊳\nExample 1.4   The SI unit of energy is\nJ =  kg m2 s–2; that of speed v is  m s–1 and\nof acceleration a is   m s–2.  Which of the\nformulae for kinetic energy (K) given below\ncan you rule out on the basis of\ndimensional arguments (m stands for the\nmass of the body) :\n(a) K = m2 v3\n(b) K = (1/2)mv2\n(c) K = ma\n(d) K = (3/16)mv2\n(e) K = (1/2)mv2 + ma\nAnswer   Every correct formula or equation must\nhave the same dimensions on both sides of the\nequation.  Also, only quantities with the same\nphysical dimensions can be added or\nsubtracted.  The dimensions of the quantity on\nthe right side are [M2 L3 T–3] for (a);  [M L2 T–2] for\n(b) and (d); [M L T–2] for (c).  The quantity on the\nright side of (e) has no proper dimensions since\ntwo quantities of different dimensions have been\nadded.  Since the kinetic energy K has the\ndimensions of [M L2 T–2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)\nare ruled out.  Note that dimensional arguments\ncannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the\ncorrect formula.  For this, one must turn to the\nactual definition of kinetic energy (see\nChapter 5).  The correct formula for kinetic\nenergy is given by (b).\n⊳\n1.6.2\nDeducing Relation among the\nPhysical Quantities\nThe method of dimensions can sometimes be\nused to deduce relation among the physical\nquantities. For this we should know the\ndependence of the physical quantity on other\nquantities (upto three physical quantities or\nlinearly independent variables) and consider it\nas a product type of the dependence. Let us take\nan example.\nExample 1.5 Consider a simple\npendulum, having a bob attached to a\nstring, that oscillates under the action of\nthe force of gravity. Suppose that the period\nof oscillation of the simple pendulum\ndepends on its length  (l), mass of the bob\n(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).\nDerive the expression for its time period\nusing method of dimensions.\nAnswer  The dependence of time period T on\nthe  quantities l, g and m as a product may be\nwritten as :\nT = k lx gy mz\nwhere k is dimensionless constant and x, y\nand z are the exponents.\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we\nhave\no\no\n1\n1\n1\n–2\n1\n[L M T ]=[L ] [L T\n] [M ]\nx\ny\nz\n= Lx+y T–2y  Mz\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides,\nwe have\nx + y = 0; –2y = 1; and z = 0\nSo that \n1\n1\n,\n–\n,\n0\n2\n2\nx\ny\nz\n=\n=\n=\nThen, T = k l½ g–½\nor, T = \nl\nk\ng\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained\nby the method of dimensions. Here it does not\nmatter if some number multiplies the right side\nof this formula, because that does not affect its\ndimensions.\nActually, k = 2π so that T = 2\nl\ng\nπ\n⊳\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing\nrelations among the interdependent physical\nquantities. However, dimensionless constants\ncannot be obtained by this method. The method\nof dimensions can only test the dimensional\nvalidity, but not  the exact relationship between\nphysical quantities in any equation. It does not\ndistinguish between the physical quantities\nhaving same dimensions.\nA number of exercises at the end of this\nchapter will help you develop skill in\ndimensional analysis.\n2024-25",
